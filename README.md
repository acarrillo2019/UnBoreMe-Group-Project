# Description
**UnBoreME** is an event finder app for bored people who want to go out and do something. A user simply inputs a category for the type of event they want to attend, in which city they are in and a radius for how far they are willing to travel. 

When the user presses the submit button, a list of events populates the page. Each event card has a title, image(if provided), description and three buttons. 

The "Event" button takes the user to an Eventful.com page with detailed event information. 

The "Share" button allows users to share the event to their own Facebook page. 

The "View Map" button triggers a modal pop-up with a Google map of the event.

# How it works
**UnBoreME** is powered by Javascript, Firebase, Ajax, the Eventful API, the Facebook API and the Google Maps API.
